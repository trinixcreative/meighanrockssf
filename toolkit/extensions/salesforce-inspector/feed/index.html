often save mine with exports, there are your recent queries available, but I&#039;d ask on the extension in the store to find out from the developer about more than recent. Sorry to not be much help. ]]></description>

Great question! I&#039;ll take a look during the day this weekend and get back to you. If I can&#039;t find out we can reach out to the creator. It is quite powerful, I use it for fields not on the page, imports, metadata downloads. It does,ale users follow their security settings if that is any help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan,
i want to promote usage of SF inspector for several key users on my org, but i need to monitor the usage of this tool in order to ensure that nobody is doing bad thing with it as it is quite powerfull. using Salesforce shield and event log files for monitoring, can you tell if there is a way to identifiy the usage of the tool (i assume in API event Type )]]></description>
