Maybe it seems\u00a0that way to me because I had Territory Management followed by Collaborative\u00a0Forecasting. However, the fact still remains,\u00a0admins need to know how to use, create, and maintain custom report types.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now there is plenty of information out there about how to create report types, Setup &#8211; Create &#8211; Report Types and go! When it comes to use, there are features without their own report types, keeping fields visible to users on-screen but removing their ability to report off said fields, renaming sections and fields to match your data model, connecting seemingly unconnected objects. I&#8217;m sure you have heard enough about it. What I want to focus on is maintenance and saving time.<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Problem<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"  wp-image-547 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/unsaved_report___salesforce_com_-_developer_edition_and_microsoft_word1-2653310600-1518074839563.png?resize=226%2C429&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"unsaved_report___salesforce_com_-_developer_edition_and_microsoft_word1.png\" width=\"226\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/unsaved_report___salesforce_com_-_developer_edition_and_microsoft_word1-2653310600-1518074839563.png?w=267&amp;ssl=1 267w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/unsaved_report___salesforce_com_-_developer_edition_and_microsoft_word1-2653310600-1518074839563.png?resize=158%2C300&amp;ssl=1 158w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As admin, we, we know the feeling of approaching deadlines all to well, and with end-user questions, training, and implementations, it seems that the effort it takes for &#8220;prettify&#8221; our custom report types, is not only is it hard to come by, I have seen orgs where it is downright nonexistent. I hate to be the one to tell you this, but that isn&#8217;t going to workout so well for you&#8230; Unmodified custom report types are awful, if you haven&#8217;t checked them out, you&#8217;re in for a doozy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">See what happens when you add object A and object B to the report type, all of object A &#8216;s fields are but into one section, and all of object B&#8217;s fields in another. Any additional fields you add related to object A go into the same section, fields related via lookup to object B are in Object B&#8217;s section.
