I could take a break for the evening to rest, but the next morning I had another big event, the Community Cloud + Salesforce.org Farewell breakfast.&nbsp; This breakfast was the opportunity for the Community Cloud to give back to non-profits and work together with Salesforce.org.&nbsp; Thomas Krawczyk had invited me to be on of the Community Cloud experts at this event, where I would be able to use myCommunity Cloud knowledge to help out existing and new non-profits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Farewell Coffee<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"257\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Farewell-Coffee-1-257x300.jpeg?resize=257%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Farewe\" class=\"wp-image-8919\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Farewell-Coffee-1.jpeg?resize=257%2C300&amp;ssl=1 257w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Farewell-Coffee-1.jpeg?w=710&amp;ssl=1 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The event started with breakfast and coffee at 9 am going til Noon. After a bit of networking a presentation started, showing off some of the basics of the community cloud, from how to build a page to the different themes.\u00a0 After the demo, Q&amp;A started. The first hands were raised, and answered by the presenter, and\u00a0then the lines started. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was announced that the people wearing yellow visors are community cloud experts and that the attendees should not hesitate to ask their questions to those of us wearing them.\u00a0 It started with a few one off easy questions. Can I do this, which type of license is need for this, do communities do this? As I answered more and more questions, the line of people waiting to have me answer questions kept growing.\u00a0 I sat down to chat with the presenter, ask about a future item and we got to talking.\u00a0 My jam for 3 years has been Communities, so users directed to me too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to say, I felt so honored that Thomas and the Community Cloud team kept directing people to me for customers and partners to have their questions answered.\u00a0 The Community cloud is my passion, as is helping people.  It was amazing to be able to help out so many people and to be able to keep helping a few of them on an ongoing basis by having them join<span style=\"color: #006dcc;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/mrockssf.site\/2TAnMDP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ohana Slack<\/a><\/span> and stay in touch via email and Twitter. Not to mention, they had great swag, with books, Community Cloud nail files, body cream, pins, stickers, collapsable Community Cloud mugs, and those sweet sweet Community Cloud visors available. I still love wearing my visor out and about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall it was an amazing Dreamforce 18.\u00a0 I had an amazing time with Ohana, be them partners, customers, or Salesforce themselves, new friends and old.\u00a0 I loved presenting each one of my sessions, they were amazing!\u00a0 It seems that others enjoyed my presentations as well, so it seems to be a win across the board.\u00a0 Like all good things, Dreamforce 18 had to come to an ended. Eventually there had to be goodbyes and we all made plans to meet up again throughout the year. I&#8217;m looking forward to an exciting 2019 and the new Ohana and learning it holds. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully I will have the opportunity to present again!\u00a0 Those of you considering presenting, I recommend starting with a Community event. Community events are smaller, more laid back, you can interact more with the audience during and after.  From there work your way up to Dreamforce, and I&#8217;ll see you on stage for #DF19 too!\u00a0 Until then, I&#8217;ll see you around the Ohana!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DFSwag-300x225.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DFSwag.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DFSwag.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DFSwag.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DFSwag.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p class=\"excerpt\">This Dreamforce was c-razy!!
