What do these two things have in common? The fact that you can brand your Salesforce, without much effort at all.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Your brand is your personality, the logo you have gives feelings to your customers. Bennioff himself said in &#8220;Behind the Cloud&#8221;,<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">A Brand is Not Just a Logo &#8211; It&#8217;s Your Most Important Asset. Which is entirely true. \u00a0Your Brand is far more than an logo, it is the feelings that come with the logo. \u00a0Your brand, can change in an instant. \u00a0Your brand differentiates you from your competitors. There are millions of dollars thrown into studying brand, and how using the same font and color scheme on your site as your ads, even for your twitter background, they are all connected. \u00a0You don&#8217;t have to take my word for it, though, I&#8217;m just a consumer that buys things because of the feelings behind it, even if American Cheese singles aren&#8217;t the best cheese, they are still the only one I can eat with tomato soup, because of the <strong>BRAND<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">So why the tangent? Here&#8217;s the deal if your brand can have that effect on customers, what affect do you think it has on employees? First off you have the sense of familiarity, they know that logo. Then you have the fact that they are part of that brand, so they are a team, and have a sense of unity. Seeing the brand reminds them of the tag line,\u00a0they know they are the brand in their own way. So lets make salesforce pretty.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">First decide which location you want your logo, I prefer A, but to each his own&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #333399;\"><strong>A. The Header Logo<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"title\">I like to change this one because we use the sidebar, and at other companies we collapsed the side bar. which means it is either full or not visible. The header however, always is. \u00a0Another advantage is the face that you can make different Apps look different. which means you will receive less emails asking where Opportunities went because a user is on &#8220;Call Center&#8221; vs Sales.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">First off you need an image that fits a 300 x 55 px area, and if it is larger, it will be scaled to fit. I recommend asking Marketing for a png to use, as a) they will have the best resolution and b) the transparent background you can have with a png makes it so you don&#8217;t have a weird white square if your image isn&#8217;t a fully filled rectangle.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">Save this in your Admin folder, and mark it as &#8220;Externally Available&#8221; with the description filled in w\/ the size, when you got the logo, and what the logo is. Next year when you change colors you&#8217;ll be so glad you did.<\/p>\n<h5 class=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #703299;\"><strong>Setup &#8211; Create-\u00a0Apps<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"title\">Here you have the &#8220;Apps&#8221; from the upper right blue circle. I recommend using &#8216;New&#8217; vs &#8216;Quick Start&#8217;. FYI, there is no clone on the list view, there is no clone ih the standard apps, and there is no &#8220;Save As&#8221;. When creating the new app, use the common tabs for the group you are designing for,\u00a0Then you can add the image you saved in &#8220;Documents&#8221; before as the logo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">Add the logo, and check who can use the &#8216;App&#8217;, move this to the default for the users that will use it, and then save. \u00a0After saving go to the non-custom app you based your new one off of, and uncheck the access boxes. \u00a0No need for clutter. Then take the list of tabs you added and the logo, and add this to your SFDC documentation.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #703299;\"><strong>Overview:<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"title\">Logo size: 300 px by 55 px, 20k or under<\/p>\n<p class=\"title\">Permissions: &#8220;View Setup and Configuration&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Customize Application&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #703299;\"><strong>B HomePage\u00a0Custom Logo<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Here you can have your logo on the side bar of the homepage. Save an image, under 100k that is &#8220;as small as possible&#8221; that is .gif .png or .jpg,<\/p>\n<p>Setup &#8211; Customize &#8211; Home &#8211; Homepage Components<\/p>\n<p>Now you want a &#8220;New&#8221; and Select Image, call it company logo or something of the such to keep it straight. \u00a0On the next page there is a scale on the page you can use to estimate your image size. The larger the image the longer the load time.<\/p>\n<p>I put my images up a few times to test the size, and once it fits the key distance, you&#8217;re &#8216;almost&#8217; all set. \u00a0Make sure to enable visibility for all profiles, and now you need to add it to the Home Page Layouts for each layout you are modifying. Now I love HomePage Layouts so that is a lot of layouts, and it is competing for space with some important components, so choose wisely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Overview<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Logo Size: small as possible under 100k and .gif, png, or .jpg<\/p>\n<p>Permissions: &#8220;View Setup and Configuration&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Customize Application&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Let me know any questions, thoughts, etc. Otherwise, have fun with your snazzy new look. \u00a0The next time someone says Reports are gone, ask which logo is in the upper left (or sidebar) and save yourself a weird drawn out conversation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"messageText\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p class=\"excerpt\">Sure you do, I do. \u00a0Nothing more fun than making people happy, especially because we can&#8217;t always say yes. \u00a0As for company pride, whether you are a new company just trying to get your name out there, or one of those fancy shmancy corporations, there is pride that comes with\u00a0standing behind your brand.
