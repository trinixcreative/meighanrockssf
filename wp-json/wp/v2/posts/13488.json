That&#8217;s right Ohana, it wouldn&#8217;t be my blog if I wasn&#8217;t talking about events and how we connect and get together as humans.\u00a0 For real, we get out from behind the keyboard, and even leave the HOUSE!!! I know, it&#8217;s crazy, but for Ohana, many of us don&#8217;t just go across town, we will travel around the world.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>So Salesforce Events, what are they? what do you do at them? where are they? who goes to them? Let&#8217;s just take this one step at .a time.\u00a0 Back in 2017 I started tracking events in a google sheet so that I could have a doc with all events in one place, I <a href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/2017\/12\/21\/salesforce-events-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared this<\/a> out and have been doing so since, and now the Salesforce Events 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Events?<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few types of events that are tracked on the Salesforce Events spreadsheet:<\/p>\n<h3>Salesforce Events<\/h3>\n<p>Salesforce events, like the big ones, that are put on by Salesforce, run by Salesforce, and a 100% Salesforce thing.\u00a0 You can submit to speak during the CFP, have coaching before your presentation with<\/p>\n<p>a handler, and these are BIG conferences &#8211; Dreamforce (SF), TrailheaDX (SF), and Connections (Chicago). They are multiple days, have a number of sponsors, keynotes, big announcements happen here. Great place to see lots of people for short amounts of time, but you will miss people at DF.\u00a0 There are tons of people at Dreamforce, it&#8217;s hard to see everyone<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13501 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=179%2C134&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meighan &amp; John at Forcelandia\" width=\"179\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/20190801_175924-scaled.jpg?w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>World Tours<\/h3>\n<p>World Tours, these are small Salesforce events that are local.\u00a0 They are run by Salesforce, have speakers, and are usually a one day event. City based World Tours usually have a couple sessions going at a time, they are great to get an introduction to the community and locals in the industry.\u00a0 WT&#8217;s are much easier to navigate than larger events, but have lots of the same content, but since they are just one day, it&#8217;s limited.<\/p>\n<h3>Community (AKA Dreamin) Events<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Dreamin Events<\/strong>, these are run by the local community &#8211; people like you that just want to bring others in Salesforce together to connect and learn.

They are locally held, but open to all, and they are ALL OVER THE WORLD!!! These are amazing ways to not only meet your local Ohana, but to see the world with Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve crossed off Southern to Northern Ireland (Road trip from Dublin to Bundoran for Surf Force ), Casablanca, Morocco (North Africa Dreamin), Amsterdam (YeruDreamin), and in March Alberta, Canada (Banff Dreamin) &#8211; then, should everything work out, in May to New Zealand (for Kiwi Dreaming) with community events.\u00a0 <strong>Seriously,<\/strong> <strong>you can see the world with Salesforce events<\/strong>. They are everywhere, from the weirdness of Portland, OR to heartland with Minneapolis, MN, to the home of the Clash with London, United Kingdom, to the first ever European Dev event in Warsaw, Poland to the Noida, India to Singapore, to Tokyo, Japan to so many others!!<\/p>\n<h3>Misc<\/h3>\n<p>Other, Non-Profit Sprints, Salesforce Days in Cities, Trailblazer days, anything besides user group events that is large enough to track is added through out the year.\u00a0 You can always find User Group meetings at <a href=\"https:\/\/mrockssf.site\/39Hm0YQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/trailblazercommunitygroups.com\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Attend Events<\/h2>\n<h3>How to Choose<\/h3>\n<p>Events are attended by us, the Salesforce Community.\u00a0 Now, how to pick which event to attend, that&#8217;s something that should be done with care.\u00a0 When picking events you need to think about a few things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is work willing to cover?<\/li>\n<li>Am I willing to self fund?<\/li>\n<li>Do I want to submit a session? (Speakers usually get a free pass to the event)<\/li>\n<li>Where is the event in relation to me?<\/li>\n<li>When is the event and how does it align with my project timeline(s)? (Eg if the event is the day of your year long project go live, then you will probably want to skip that event and do a different one)<\/li>\n<li>What is the event theme and am I interested? (Eg. If the event in your area is about non-profits and you don&#8217;t do non-profit work, ever, then you might want to consider a different event)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Talk to Your Boss<\/h3>\n<p>So, reviewing the questions above should help you pick the events you want to go to.\u00a0 Personally, I self fund my international events and some of my US events.\u00a0 I really like going to events, and that&#8217;s awesome, nothing wrong with wanting to spend my time doing<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-7878 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?resize=231%2C155&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?w=2256&amp;ssl=1 2256w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/MedieAndME-e1541312004318.jpg?w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Salesforce things and meeting new Salesforce people and learning new Salesforce things, but I do not expect my employer to pay for me to fly all over the world for every single event I want to go to, that wouldn&#8217;t be realistic.\u00a0 So, talk to your boss, see what they will<\/p>\n<p>cover and see what can be worked out.\u00a0 Maybe they will cover x number of events, or maybe they will do learning time vs PTO, or maybe they will do event expenses &#8211; you never know til you ask.<\/p>\n<p>Now we are almost ready for an event, we have permission from work, they have agreed to cover a few community events (yay!!) now we need to find out which one to go to.\u00a0 This is where the Twitter, the event website, the session list, and how the event aligns with your projects comes into play.\u00a0 Lots of events have sessions that people are trying out for DF or have done at DF, that&#8217;s something to keep in mind. This content is good so you don&#8217;t want to spend the whole event staring at your laptop working. Make sure that you can spend time in the sessions and with the others connecting.\u00a0 The community events are priceless for connections. Use the Salesforce Events 2020 list to help simplify your search.<\/p>\n<h2>Salesforce Events 2020<\/h2>\n<p>So, where is this document with these events I keep hyping up?<\/p>\n<p>Well, couple more things&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>First off, if you want to talk about events, you can talk about them on the Twitters, here is my <a href=\"https:\/\/mrockssf.site\/2P1d0pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salesforce Community Events Twitter List<\/a>, which I try to catch all the new Dreamin&#8217; AKA Community events that come up and add their handles to the list.\u00a0 Second, on <a href=\"https:\/\/mrockssf.site\/2ooiWPo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#OhanaSlack<\/a> we have a number of event channels, the event channels all start with event-, just click on channels to add once you join. Third, the Trailblazer Community, some events have Chatter Groups, you can join even if you can&#8217;t attend to keep up on what&#8217;s up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mrockssf.site\/2HuxQt5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salesforce Events 2020 Document<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRj79PR2uoKeKTzATCSCnQ_DoKkT3CTFiG0AftG77ow6I9tky7du7xzrmNaqRtf1tZhRJg-jclya1DY\/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget to see me at<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/banffdreamin\"> #BanffDreamin<\/a> (@BanffDreamin) and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TNDConf\">#TrueNorthDreamin<\/a> in Canada where I will be speaking about Community Cloud in March and April!
