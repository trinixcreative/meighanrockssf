Guest Users are users that can see your community before they login &#8211; an Unauthenticated user. Each time a community or portal is created, Salesforce auto-creates a guest user profile and a site guest user record. No matter what. Even if your community is authenticated, you have a guest user. The site guest user record is the only user record associated with the guest user profile. The Guest User works like other user records in Salesforce, so you can add it to assignment rules, queues, public groups, manual sharing, and permission sets.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unique Quirks of Guest Users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The guest user profile is specific to the community or portal. You will want to check the guest user profile for each of your communities or portals to ensure object\/data security (we will review that later).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the community is active, guest users can access a subset of community pages, such as login and error pages.&nbsp; From there you can expand the pages visible by making pages or your community as a whole public.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Guest User Access Report AppExchange package to understand if records are being shared with guest users (this is explained in the tips and tricks sections).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you access the guest profile? Well you can do this in 2 different ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>From Builder go to the Gear on the Left Side, go to: General &#8211; Click the Guest Profile Name<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"886\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Community_Builder.jpg?resize=1080%2C886&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Community_Builder.jpg?w=1426&amp;ssl=1 1426w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Community_Builder.jpg?resize=300%2C246&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Community_Builder.jpg?resize=1024%2C840&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Community_Builder.jpg?resize=768%2C630&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>From Setup go to Sites: click your Community Name &#8211; Select Public Access &#8211; You\u2019re on your Guest User<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pages<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Setup Communities to be Private or Public<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you allow public access, your community pages are accessible to the public, including unlicensed users.

Then, assign the guest a different layout using variations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also an option to modify the visibility on the component level, making specific components, such as Tiles, the list view component, and make them display for only some users.&nbsp; To make a component on a public page visible to guest users, select <strong>Publicly available<\/strong>&nbsp;in the <em>component\u2019s<\/em> properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page Details &amp; Config<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Regardless of the settings, some pages are always public, and others are always private. Public pages include login-related pages (Login, Register, Forgot Password, Login Error, Check Password). The Messages page for direct messages is always private.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If public access is enabled in Community Builder at the page or community level, the&nbsp;<strong>Let guest users view asset files on public pages <\/strong>preference is enabled at <strong>Workspaces<\/strong> | <strong>Administration<\/strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<strong>Preferences.&nbsp; <\/strong>This preference lets guest users view asset files shared with the community on publicly accessible pages. It remains enabled if the page has public access enabled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Community Builder is a powerful tool for keeping your Lightning community or portal secure. Keep these best practices and considerations in mind when working with access levels in Lightning communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t create object pages for objects not exposed to community users. Delete object pages that aren\u2019t being used.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use generic record pages when possible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you remove chatter from the generic record page.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Update the record detail pages to use the tabs with details and related &amp; feed on a content with sidebar layout vs full width<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you set up object pages for authenticated users, test the pages to ensure that guest users can\u2019t see them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Best Practices for Guest Users on Object Pages<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Out of the box, when guest users create records, they are redirected to the homepage. To send to a different screen, create a flow and use a flow action for redirection. *Read ton before just redirecting* (<a href=\"https:\/\/unofficialsf.com\/flow-actions\/?utm_source=MRSFBlog&amp;utm_medium=page&amp;utm_content=flow-actions&amp;utm_campaign=communitysharing2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unofficial Flow Site Lightning Actions<\/a>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you go custom and decide to send the Guest User to the record just created, remember that guest users loses access to the record they just created since it is reassigned immediately. Consider taking the user to a page other than the record detail, as if you share the record with the guest, there is only 1 guest on your community so you would be sharing with all users that are unauthenticated.\n<ul>\n<li>Salesforce recommends considering changing your implementation to redirect the guest user to a different part of your site after creating a record.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guest users may have the option of associating a newly created record to a parent record via a lookup. An example is creating a contact and associating it to an account. Because guest users lose access after they create them, if the guest creates an Account with a related Contact, they would get an error saving the Contact because they lost access to the Account after creating it.\u00a0 To avoid errors, you can:\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that your org has a generic parent record shared with guest users via a sharing rule, (remember from above how that Guest User is just a normal user so they can be added to Sharing Rules) so new children are visible.\n<ul>\n<li>REMEMBER Your generic record shouldn&#8217;t have any private or sensitive data you don&#8217;t want shared out with the whole world<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure to remove unnecessary create permissions for guests. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"text-transform:capitalize\">Search and your guest Users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Guest User Profile controls what unauthenticated users can see in your community, be it public or private.&nbsp; The Guest User Profile sees what your unauthenticated users see. To make an object\u2019s records available for search indexing, you must provide at least read access to that object and its fields to the Guest User Profile.&nbsp; Keep in mind this opens up the records shared with the Guest User has with the whole wide world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Community Builder, make sure that the community is publicly available. Select Public can access the community in <strong>Settings | General,<\/strong> this also enables the SEO settings tab.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the SEO settings tab, configure which objects are public using the Guest User Profile.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click Guest User Profile.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click Edit, and in the Standard Object Permissions section, give at least read access to the object.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save your changes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Field-Level Security section, select View beside the object and ensure that the appropriate fields have at least read access.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save your changes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Community Builder, create object pages for the object, if they don\u2019t exist.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Activate your community, if you haven\u2019t yet. **NOTE: Always review which objects your Guest User Profile has access to before activating and publishing your community. This best practice controls your sitemap.xml file and helps keep your community safe &amp; secure.**<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>To make your changes live, publish your community.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It can take up to 24 hours for the list of available objects to appear, along with the number of indexed records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search Best Practices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When setting up your search pages and components for communities and portals, keep these best practices and considerations in mind to keep data secure from guest users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search Page<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Review page access settings for the search page to ensure that you want the search page accessed by guest users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>To limit access to the search page, consider creating a search page variation with a guest audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Global Search Results Component<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Global Search Results component is the main component on the Search page in any community. The component allows admins to select the objects shown in search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Guest users only see results on objects they have access to.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual record access for the guest user isn\u2019t limited to the objects the admin configures in the Global Search Results component. The guest user can have access to other objects based on org sharing configurations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always check the org\u2019s sharing model (including org-wide defaults and sharing rules) to ensure that the guest user doesn\u2019t have access to your org\u2019s sensitive data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search Box Component<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>As with the Global Search Results component, the admin sets up which objects to show in searches. However, record access for the guest user isn\u2019t limited to the objects the admin configures in the Global Search Box and Global Search for Peer-to-Peer Communities components. The guest user can have access to other objects based on org sharing configurations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Always check the org\u2019s sharing model (including org-wide defaults and sharing rules) to ensure the guest user doesn\u2019t have access to your org\u2019s sensitive data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well folks, that&#8217;s Community Sharing Part 2, our first section on guests and sharing\/security.&nbsp; Next up we&#8217;ll jump into the how does that Guest sharing on objects work, best practices, SEO and what settings should you be concerned with.&nbsp; All on our exciting adventure through Community Sharing in Salesforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"gm143fcc1\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-m10 section-gm143fcc1 gutentor-module g-gm-module\"><div class=\"grid-container\"><div class=\"grid-row g-gm-item-wrap\">\n<div id=\"col-gma2d160\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-m10-col col-gma2d160 gutentor-module g-gm-col grid-lg-6 grid-md-4 grid-12\"><div id=\"section-gma2d160\" class=\"section-gma2d160 gutentor-single-col\">\n<div id=\"section-g4e8c8f\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-e6 section-g4e8c8f gutentor-element gutentor-element-image\"><div class=\"gutentor-element-image-box\"><a class=\"gutentor-element-image-link\" href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/2019\/10\/29\/sharing-sets\/\"><div class=\"gutentor-image-thumb\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"normal-image\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Community-Sharing-Part-1_-Sharing-Sets.jpg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Community Sharing Part 1_ Sharing Sets\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"col-gmadefbf\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-m10-col col-gmadefbf gutentor-module g-gm-col grid-lg-6 grid-md-4 grid-12\"><div id=\"section-gmadefbf\" class=\"section-gmadefbf gutentor-single-col\">\n<div id=\"section-g7cee46\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-e6 section-g7cee46 gutentor-element gutentor-element-image\"><div class=\"gutentor-element-image-box\"><a class=\"gutentor-element-image-link\" href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/2020\/09\/08\/community-sharing-part-3-channel-programs\/\"><div class=\"gutentor-image-thumb\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"normal-image\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Channel-Programs.jpg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Channel Programs\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"col-gm796051\" class=\"wp-block-gutentor-m10-col col-gm796051 gutentor-module g-gm-col grid-lg-6 grid-md-4 grid-12\"><div id=\"section-gm796051\" class=\"section-gm796051 gutentor-single-col\"><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p class=\"excerpt\">This post we expore guest user visibily in Experience Cloud.
