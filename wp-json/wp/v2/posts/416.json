For those of you unfamiliar with a Named Account Model\u00a0(AKA Strategic Account, Key Accounts, Enterprise Account, Global Account List), the Sales Team members\u00a0are assigned\u00a0a predetermined set of Accounts for outbound prospecting, rather than working inbound leads\u00a0assigned based on territory (either geo or vertical based). \u00a0Accounts are selected based on their revenue, geo, industry, similarity to your current customers, need for your product, fit for your product, current customer status, and existing relationship between your company\u00a0and theirs. \u00a0Named Account team members are assigned between 10-50 Named\u00a0Accounts each. The alignment of account to user\u00a0is determined based on\u00a0leadership, proximity of\u00a0the team member to the customer, ownership of\u00a0current customer accounts, users&#8217; primary industry based on skills and sales history, and the relationship\u00a0individual users\u00a0have with the target company.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">The\u00a0NAL\u00a0is preloaded\u00a0into Salesforce with the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/DnBAbout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">D&amp;B data<\/span><\/a>, with the primary Named Account being either a) the holding company at the top of the hierarchy globally (<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1gKTARj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Global Ultimate Parent<\/span><\/a>,\u00a0GUP) or b) the highest account regionally (<a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1gKTARj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Domestic Ultimate Parent<\/span><\/a>, DUP). \u00a0The child accounts that role up to the holding company are also assigned to\u00a0the\u00a0rep, either entirely or regionally. \u00a0The Named Account team only works Named Account hierarchies, they need to, and all\u00a0inbound leads from companies\u00a0outside of this list handled by the Corporate Sales team. \u00a0The model\u00a0is designed\u00a0to\u00a0utilize and benefit from the\u00a0existing network connections\u00a0sales team members have, bringing in higher revenue and long-term relationships. \u00a0They will need to study the companies, employee relationships, in their account planning\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0and present the\u00a0use case and solution to the customer.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">Many admins dread the Named Account List, and, it is understandable. \u00a0A strong team with diverse knowledge and strong skill sets will greatly aid in completing the project. The three primary are data analysis, business process, and technical design &amp; development.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">Data analysis\u00a0is used,\u00a0to create the list and align to users based historic data for new customer revenue, renewal rates, your churn rates, all by industry, revenue for the company &amp; each team member, and\u00a0individual\u00a0user performance trends.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">Business process\u00a0is used\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0how to structure the marketing, how should the account management be designed, rep requirements, ROE,\u00a0methodology, you know, the business-y stuff.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">The technical side is making the process work with the data in Salesforce. You\u00a0determine\u00a0what is best for your org, while making the design flexible for future change, yet stable with a limited impact on user.\u00a0 This also involves an\u00a0on-going\u00a0support plan, usability monitoring, and keeping your documentation up to date.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">Before Phase 1 of your project, it is important to sit down with sales leadership and understand why a Named Account Model\u00a0is being considered\u00a0and what should be the result of the change.\u00a0 This is a decision not\u00a0to be\u00a0taken lightly, and just grabbing the\u00a0F500\u00a0list and saying, &#8220;let&#8217;s do this,&#8221; will only have a negative impact.\u00a0 The companies selected, the number of companies, the account management plan the sales team will be following, the ROE, the amount of work put into these decisions and from there the model itself is directly related to\u00a0whether or not\u00a0there will be success with the implementation.\u00a0 I have seen firsthand planned vs. slapped together\u00a0NAMs, everyone needs to understand the goals.\u00a0 In addition, you need\u00a0to be\u00a0in these meetings with leadership so you can properly understand their goals and ideas; emails and second-hand knowledge can lead to design flaws and implementation fails (which in turn lead to sales team fails).<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">The decision to implement a Named Account Model, cannot be made by one team alone, you must bring in marketing.\u00a0 You\u00a0will not be\u00a0successful if they are not properly informed of the idea, and brought into the decision-making.\u00a0 If marketing is unable to support the change\u00a0currently, you cannot make the change now.\u00a0 Everyone needs to work together to\u00a0determine the best project start date, deployment date(s), and\u00a0additional\u00a0requirements for their team.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">Once you have reviewed the reasons for the implementation and sales, marketing, and operations (you) teams agree that a NAM is the right way to go, you need to continue to communicate.\u00a0 Implementing a NAM does not only affect the sales process or every single Salesforce User, but every single person in every department related to customers (directly or indirectly). That means the Named Account Team, Corporate Sales, Account Development, Marketing, Finance, Support, Services, Customer Success, Product Development, Leadership, EVERYONE needs to be in the loop regarding the implementation.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">So before you start working on your NAM, you need to let everyone know what a NAM is, that you are doing it, why you are doing it, and then regularly update them with the status.\u00a0 The people that need the most information and a voice in your implementation are all Sales, SalesOps, Marketing, and all Leadership.\u00a0 I have to stress this again, you <strong>MUST<\/strong> communicate with all departments the details of this project. \u00a0Think of it this way, every time you don&#8217;t\u00a0inform\u00a0other departments about your project, a kitten dies. Don&#8217;t kill kittens, please.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\">In\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/2015\/09\/21\/named-account-implementation-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: #f25f70;\">Part 2<\/span><\/a>\u00a0we will\u00a0review\u00a0the project planning &amp; requirements, with links to documents to get you started.<span style=\"color: #404040;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/meighanrockssf.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/01\/010416_0600_namedaccoun3.png?w=1080\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #404040; font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Related Posts:<\/strong><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3690\" style=\"width: 457px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/2015\/09\/21\/named-account-implementation-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3690\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3690\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/named-accounts-part-2.jpg?resize=447%2C170&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"named-accounts-part-2\" width=\"447\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/named-accounts-part-2.jpg?w=820&amp;ssl=1 820w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/named-accounts-part-2.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/named-accounts-part-2.jpg?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3690\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Part 2: Building Your List.
