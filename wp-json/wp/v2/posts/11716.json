I know, I know, we aren&#8217;t supposed to pick favorite children, but of all my cloud children, I love this one the most for good reason. Why you ask? Well, tons of reasons, and it&#8217;s because a Community works so much differently than regular Salesforce. You are taking your org and exposing things in an entirely different way, sharing your data to your Customers and Partners. You are building your very own &#8216;Ohana&#8217;, creating a way for your external users to connect with one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the concept of exposing your data externally, you will need to keep in mind security for your data.&nbsp; That is what this mini-series in my blog is all about.&nbsp; We will be reviewing a variety of items specific to Communities that are related to sharing.

Problem there.. LIMITS!&nbsp; You have only 50 sharing rules per object that you can make.&nbsp; &nbsp;As your community grows and you think about how many accounts you will be using or how many users you will be activating you will quickly, and let me tell you, OH oh, oh, so quickly run out of sharing rules. No need to fear&#8230; Sharing sets are here to save the day!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sharing-sets\">Sharing Sets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing Sets are an amazing superpower that comes with your Communities.&nbsp; They are a way to share with Community License types and Community users. Keep in mind, this type of security and sharing is only available for your community users, it is not available to share with internal users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"history-vs-present\">History vs Present<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time there needed to be a way to share with your Customer Community (CC) users.&nbsp; Since they don&#8217;t have roles and aren&#8217;t able to be in Public Groups, they can&#8217;t have manual sharing. So to do so Salesforce came up with a magical way to share on large volume levels that wouldn&#8217;t take a huge toll on the system. Sharing Sets.&nbsp; Now, as of recently, this functionality has been expanded to not only be available for Customer Community (CC) but also Customer Community Plus (CC+) and Partner Licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-they-work\">How They Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing Sets work different than most other sharing you will think about in the Salesforce world, and totally differently than the sharing that you are used to for internal users. Let&#8217;s break this part down&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know those global variables that work oh so awesomely in <a href=\"https:\/\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/2015\/07\/29\/my-requests-dynamic-view\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">formulas<\/a>?&nbsp; So here&#8217;s how it works, Global Variables, match a variable make a formula true.&nbsp; This is very similar to how your Sharing Sets work.&nbsp; Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have your User.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The User is always connected to a Contact (or Person Account), that&#8217;s how you created your community User.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This Contact is the User.ContactId<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Contact also has an Account, the User.Contact.AccountId<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can also use the User.ContactAccount, these are your Account Contact Relationships<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you have your records.&nbsp; Records can be shared if they have a ContactId or AccountId.&nbsp; What Sharing Sets do is say hey I am this logged in User.&nbsp; My User.Contact.AccountId = x, the AccountId on this record = x, because they match I can see this record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the AccountId on the record was y then it would not be visible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"objects-for-sharing-sets\">Objects for Sharing Sets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following objects can be used with sharing sets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Account<br>Account sharing sets can control access to Contract, Entitlement, and OrderItem objects<br>Asset<br>Campaign<br>Case<br>Contact<br>Custom Objects<br>Individual<br>Lead (contact Salesforce Customer Support to enable)<br>Opportunity<br>Order<br>ServiceAppointment<br>Service Contract<br>User<br>Work Order<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-available-objects-list-excludes\">The Available Objects list excludes:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Objects with an organization-wide sharing setting of Public Read\/Write<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom objects that don\u2019t have an account or contact lookup field<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sharing-set-checklist\">Sharing Set Checklist<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your Org Wide Defaults as Private for your External Sharing Model<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You know the objects you want to share<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You have your Custom Profiles created for your Community Users<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your Custom Profile(s) have the objects with the proper CRUD access<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-set-it-up\">How to Set it Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First off you need to know that you can only have one Sharing Set per Community Profile.&nbsp; So that means you create the sharing set for the profile and all the objects are within that sharing set.&nbsp; You can only share each object one way.&nbsp; Objects must be Private to show up in the list of objects for Sharing Sets. Sometimes you&#8217;ll be looking for an object to find out that your OWD has the object as Public Read\/Write, switch it to Private to do Sharing Sets on it.
