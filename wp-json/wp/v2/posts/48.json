This is a bit more of a Salesforce limitation that you can only have a snapshot of 100 fields, there are only so many per day, how tables can&#8217;t hide details, but that is a limit. Plus I don&#8217;t want to run a report in SF for every object with adding fields and such.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Metadata Snapshot on the Appexchange\" href=\"https:\/\/appexchange.salesforce.com\/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003Ih3aEAC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metadata Snapshot on the AppExchange<\/a>\u00a0(new window)<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #333399;\"><a style=\"color: #333399; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1O6f7Rg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethos EasyDescribe.<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>I love this guy, I really do. \u00a0I have been using the app for awhile, so I am used to it,\u00a0and I just like all of our End Users, might like cool new things, but I&#8217;m scared of change and if it&#8217;s not broke why fix it?<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">What does it does:<\/span> Lets you\u00a0view &amp;\u00a0extract object metadata details\u00a0with\u00a0recordtypes, field types, picklists, and other metadata all on one screen. Easy export to excel.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Cost:<\/span> \u00a0Free<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Why I like it:<\/span> \u00a0You can see your help text, the formula text, all child objects. You can see vital information for each field such as name,\u00a0API name, if you can edit it, if it is custom, number of characters, if it is dependent, if it is a lookup and if so to what, and picklist values. Plus you get your little shortcut code, 001 &amp; \u00a0Record types are available. Another benefit is the fact that you can use one object at a time, so if you are working with a sepcific set of objects, you don&#8217;t need to export the Org design to find out how to design your project object structure. \u00a0Export to Excel, this is so vital for storing each month the development of our org.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Why I don&#8217;t like it:<\/span>\u00a0It is on a Visualforce page, without the ability to store the data automagically. \u00a0Yes, it gives you your &#8220;Picklist&#8221; values, but you have to click an Extract link&#8230; on EVERY PICKLIST to get them. Plus, it does each object individually. \u00a0Yes, I have this as why I like it but why can&#8217;t I flag the objects I like and do them at once.<\/p>\n<p>Etherios EasyDescribe: \u00a0<a title=\"Etherios EasyDescribe\" href=\"https:\/\/appexchange.salesforce.com\/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000018leZEAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/appexchange.salesforce.com\/listingDetail?listingId=a0N300000018leZEAQ<\/a><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #333399;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #333399; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1n5wWa6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Octopus.<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-117 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/octopuslogo.jpg?resize=217%2C180&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Octopus by Astrea Logo\" width=\"217\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/octopuslogo.jpg?w=294&amp;ssl=1 294w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/octopuslogo.jpg?resize=150%2C124&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>This is another lovely freebie. \u00a0All you do is add the App, go to the Octopus tab, then select the check box for the items you want the extract.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">What it does: \u00a0<\/span>Exports your metadata fast and easy from Salesforce from, one selection page. Includes items like,\u00a0Apex Classes,\u00a0Components to Jobs to fields to Dashboards, mail merge, profiles, queues, user, roles, VF workflow, etc<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Cost:<\/span> \u00a0Free<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">What I like:<\/span> \u00a0This not only gives me fields, but it LISTS THE VALUES IN THE PICKLIST! For real, it does that, right there in a square on the table. This can be pulled up right away with a HTML page you can save later, which is great when you need an answer on the fly. \u00a0Your apex is right there, and you can get all your custom object fields and standard objects with custom fields all at once. I also use it for my Workflow Rules, pretty decent setup.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">What I don&#8217;t like:<\/span> \u00a0It is in Word, HTML, or a PDF, which all format funky in Excel. \u00a0even if you just import text, something somehow goes wrong if I don&#8217;t make a table in Word with the data first (Using Excel 13). In addition, you don&#8217;t get as much information as you would like. It is slightly frustrating when using it for more than a quick lookup.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Octopus on the AppExchange\" href=\"https:\/\/appexchange.salesforce.com\/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B5cEKEAZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Octopus on\u00a0the AppExchange<\/a>\u00a0(opens new window)<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Enabler for Excel \u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-119 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/enabler4excel-300x38.png?resize=513%2C65&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"enabler4excel\" width=\"513\" height=\"65\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/enabler4excel.png?resize=300%2C38&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/enabler4excel.png?resize=768%2C97&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/meighanrockssf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/enabler4excel.png?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I use this app DAILY. \u00a0It is not only used for my metadata needs, \ud83d\ude42 It is an Excel add-on, that lets you export to Excel with the click of a button. I use this with TM 2.0 (territory management 2.0) to review Users by Territory, Accounts by Territory, Territory Hierarchies, Email Templates (great for HTML templates as I recently learned). \u00a0I like that it is a Heroku app, as I work on my Journey to become a Force.com Master, seeing that apps others made using the same tools I am using, makes me feel like I will be able to help someone in the future,\u00a0but that&#8217;s a personal pro.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">What does it does:<\/span> Enables easy mass updates, inserts, and deletes. PLUS, it has extra functionality showing\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">which fields are in and out of layouts<\/span>, PLUS field(s) utilization calculation (like field trip), and it does VisualForce from layout page generation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Cost:<\/span> \u00a0Paid, $10 per month OR $100\/year per computer<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Why I like it:<\/span>\u00a0It is an Excel add-on so you can click a button in Excel then work\u00a0right there with your data. \u00a0You have\u00a0Dataloader opertions such as\u00a0get, insert, update, delete, upsert, but without .csv files. \u00a0Use do a\u00a0SOQL query, change a couple of fields, and push them back into the database in a couple of minutes without leaving Excel.\u00a0If you &#8220;Save As&#8221; you have a backup right then and there. \u00a0Then, 30 day trial with no limit on the amount of data that you manipulate. \u00a0You can hit the little extras button on Login to use the Web login and bypass using your token.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Extra Bonus:<\/span><\/strong> \u00a0It works with Group and Professional<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333399;\">The\u00a0downside:<\/span> \u00a0Well, being paid is an immediate downer. \u00a0Other than that, it isn&#8217;t in Salesforce, so you do need to export. \u00a0If you import, you are directly importing what you have, there is no &#8220;are you sure&#8221;. \u00a0Personally, I get frustrated with the fact that when you do an import or upsert. you need to UN-map the system fields or it will fail (E.g. Created By, Last Modified Date&#8230;) The page layout stuff needs to be done one at a time. \u00a0This is petty I know, but there it a popup that you need to click every single time you open Excel, and you can&#8217;t just get your question answered on their Wiki, they make you walk through EVERYTHING.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, I like it, I use it, I will\u00a0keep using it. \u00a0It isn&#8217;t a replacement for the Dataloader, don&#8217;t think that because you can avoid .csv files it is. \u00a0First off, you don&#8217;t get a backup, there aren&#8217;t self generated success and error files, and no batch. Really hand for minor fixes, to manipulate data (E.g. Wrong Lead Source, incorrect campaign, bobby left the company)<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Excel Enabler AppExchange Listing\" href=\"https:\/\/appexchange.salesforce.com\/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B3GBzEAN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Excel Enabler on the AppExchange<\/a> (Opens New Window)<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333399;\">Now you have some cool new tools, and a heck of a lot of documents that you will not use on a regular basis&#8230;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>What ever shall you do with these documents? \u00a0Well you could store them on your hard drive, email copies as people need them, that they might not remember or might not save so they use one from 3 years ago and erase all your Revenue. \u00a0You could just put them in a file and never think of them again, but go hey at least I did it. \u00a0Then when you move on your successor will have no idea how to use Salesforce. \u00a0OR&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You can share them on the cloud, one folder for ADMIN stuff one for END USER training. \u00a0Use security to say who gets what, then grant access as needed to others. \u00a0Starting to get there&#8230;. Content works great for this, unless half your company doesn&#8217;t use Salesforce, and lets admit it, we aren&#8217;t all Wall to Wall SF.<\/p>\n<p>You feeling like you want to go above and beyond? Make a SharePoint site. \u00a0This is what I think is the best idea IF you have enough people and enough reasons to do it, otherwise it is over kill. \u00a0You can make a folder structure with a Wikis, Documents, Lists, Project Calendars, Announcements. \u00a0Main site is your ADMIN stuff, metadata, integrations down to the detail, then share what users need, Marketing gets your marketing automation stuff, so does sales, but not the integration part, just the easy reading docs.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Use the Wiki to have Validation Rules there to find out WHY the data import didn&#8217;t work, WHY they can&#8217;t close a deal. \u00a0Put a custom link in Salesforce, show that sidebar, and let then gain access. \u00a0Have an Account List? RoE? put that in the links too, help your users help themselves. \u00a0If they can solve the problem without calling you, they will be less scared of Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>Other advantages? \u00a0Well they can have Sales Managers storing docs here too, and Marketing can tell them about the campaign import, and you can see the csv file marketing uploaded in case we need to &#8220;un-do&#8221;. \u00a0Make a community page, users can then give each other advice, and know what document they are using? That one you just put up, because it is ONE link, to ONE place, with UP-TO-DATE information with versioning so you don&#8217;t lose the old one, just in case. Don&#8217;t forget a web-to-Case form on the site so they can reach out if they need to. What are you going to do? You can sit back, and create a subsite with your project folders, shared with the Executive Sponsors &amp; other team members, and focus on making thing better, rather than fighting fires.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you everyone, that is it for the first post. \u00a0Please let me know any thoughts or questions, I can&#8217;t improve without your help.<\/p>\n<p><del><br \/>\nHey all, finally took the step to create a blog.
