Thanks for responding so quickly!  Much appreciated.  I had read about this approach, but was wondering if the manager field had been made available in the templates yet.  Oh well!]]></description>

Sadly no, this has not yet been resolved. You can set a dynamic hidden field with the manager on the record and use that,but no option to select the manager for email templates without extra configuration. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f615.png" alt="ðŸ˜•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For example if you want to email the opportunity owner manager, create a lookup field on the Opportunity object called Owner Manager. Then use a process builder to set the field value, you can use the lookup field on the record with your email templates as a related user to send to.
You could also use an email field, but I find the lookup to be more useful for scalability. Mind you, this field won&#039;t populate automatically, so you&#039;ll have to update historical and new/updated records as the owner changes.
Maybe one day.  Luckily they re-opened this idea for consideration.]]></description>
