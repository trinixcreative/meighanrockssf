There are custom actions included that you can use instead of the buttons in the package already! :-)  I will update the instructions to make it more clear]]></description>

You need to set the default workflow user at Setup - Create - Workflow and Approvals - Process Settings.  
I have updated the version since you installed to no longer include the fields that caused you the error.
Have you installed previously? Another user installed the app in their production org rather than deploying from their sandbox and had the same error when trying to upgrade since it is an unmanaged package, if you have preciously installed, please let me know.

Either way, please try with the updated package to try and resolve the errors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan, I sure would love to install but I&#039;m getting the same errors that have already been reported and haven&#039;t seen any replies from you so pretty disappointed.  Looks like you did such a great job on this and we&#039;d love to use it.  Any chance you will address the install errors?  Thank you.]]></description>

I am going to try implementing it next week! Might be worth revisiting the article (some links are broken like full list of fields) and updating it for lightning!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan,

This looks like a great custom object to use on our organization&#039;s platform. However, the app is not downloading successfully... Just wondering if this is still available to install?]]></description>
