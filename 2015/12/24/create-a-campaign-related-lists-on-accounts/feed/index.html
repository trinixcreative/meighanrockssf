You are absolutely able to customize the related list on Accounts to show the Campaign Names the Account has been associated with!  Due to the fact that the Lookup relationship is added to the Campaign Member the Account now has the ability to show the Campaign name from that record.  Just add the related list and select the Campaign Name as one of the fields to show and Boom! :-)

The first image shows the related list from the account here &lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/meighanrockssf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rtaimage.png?w=796&amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Account Campaign Related List&quot; /&gt;]]></description>

IF you export the Ids using the data loader of the Campaign Members that are contacts with the query, 
SELECT Id from CampaignMember WHERE ContactId != null
then do an update with the data loader, using the file with the Ids you just exported, only map the Id to the Campaign Member Id, and run, it should trigger the process to fire and update your Campaign Members with contacts.  If it doesn&#039;t work for you, let me know.]]></description>

I am not getting the same error, can you share the error message?  I also updated the app if you want to try the new version.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this Meighan!

It&#039;s nearly perfect for me, but the process is preventing campaign members being created for lead records. I applied the criteria according to what you shared, but maybe I&#039;m missing something?]]></description>
