					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how to thank you for this great tutorial. It was so clean and easy to follow. Just one thing for the readers, in order for the contents of the detail page to be visible, the website needs to be published. Thanks again:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] CMS Connect lets you connect to outside services, be it with or without authorization. It is most commonly used with connecting to outside sources so that data does not need to be replicated and maintained in multiple places. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan,

Great post! This will help me alot. 
I have another question though. It is mentioned that CMS Connect can work with Wordpress, but the issue is that CMS Connect needs HTML elements for the header and footer but WordPress uses PHP. Can I just link to the URL of the PHP components for the header and footer? Or should I do it in another way? I&#039;ve been experimenting with different things but nothing works now. 

The errors I&#039;m getting though are all CORS related. But I&#039;ve done everything that is mentioned in this post with CORS. 

Thanks,

Emiel]]></description>

You can find more information about how to setup CORS, including the setup steps, in my first post in CMS connect here: https://wp.me/p9y39G-117. Hope this helps, let me know if you need more information.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Meighan, really useful info, this is a unique post. There&#039;s a sentence that makes me think you need to insert something into your website, but I&#039;m not clear what needs to be inserted: &quot;CMS Connect uses Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to access external content. Make sure to add Community Host to the list of trusted hosts in the CORS header in your CMS system.&quot; Any help, or direction to another article that can help me understand what to insert, would be great, thank you! (ps, not sure if it matters, but I&#039;m looking to grab blog posts from our Wordpress site, that are public (no login needed).]]></description>
