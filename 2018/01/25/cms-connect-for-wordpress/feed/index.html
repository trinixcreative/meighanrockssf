That looks great! How would I do that with wordpress? I&#039;ve been fiddling around with it but don&#039;t know what links to put in the header and footer paths.

Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m trying to use CMS Connect to display my wordpress header/footer on my community. Is that possible? It looks like I need to provide a header path and footer path and I have no idea what to give it.

Thanks!]]></description>

Couple questions for you: 1. Are you connecting WordPress as well? 2. Is your site http or https? 3. Did you follow the instructions above or did you follow the links seen through out the post for the updated CMS Connect Component setup for the CMS Connect 18 Update Post? Again, here is the link for the instructions for the update, there are a few items mapped differently: https://meighanrockssf.com/2018/06/21/cms-connect-18-updates/ 4. Where do you get your error? A field in the component? the List Component? The Detail component? 5. What fields are you mapping? 6. Is your site authenticated or unauthenticated? 7. Did you by chance, have any pop ups to approved any content connections within the builder, similar to images?
I just need more info than what you have stated above. Thanks!]]></description>

The header and Footer are a bit different than the regular CMS they require configuration in the side gear as well. Happy to add as a new post in the future]]></description>
