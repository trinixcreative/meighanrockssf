I have moved flows themselves with a Deployment (Change Set, HaoIDE, DX, GearSet, etc) and the assignment to the Profile (the login flow part) I have done that manually in the next org. They are not available in change sets and I haven&#039;t seen them in GearSet or Metadata API. If anyone else has please let me know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

A quick question a bit related to the topic, I&#039;ve been looking everywhere.
Can you deploy Login Flow using sfdx?

Thanks.]]></description>

Hey Matt, I&#039;ve done flows to assign profiles and perm sets to users before, as well as send the initial activation email, but I haven&#039;t tried the reset password. If the Standard OOTB button isn&#039;t available, could try sending an email template for a custom field that sends the reset password email vs using the standard. Let me play around with it this weekend and see what I can find. Let me know if you want to have a call next week or after the New Year.
BTW so stoked to hear you put my trailmoji sticker on your laptop <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="üòç" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> looking forward to talking with you soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan!  Matt Kelly here.  I was in your success circle on release management at DF19 a couple of weeks ago.  I was researching the possibility of building a flow that would allow a business unit admin to add their own SFDC users and assign the correct profiles based on the needs of that business unit.

Initial research was you could get all the way up to creating the user, but then you have to manually go into the User&#039;s record to trigger the email to reset their password.

I was LITERALLY thinking, as I went to page four of the Google results, &quot;I have to believe Meighan&#039;s run into this before and would know, but I&#039;m not at the point of bugging her on the slack channel.  Then, like a shining beacon was this blog post!!!

This post has to do with Login flows.  Have you had the opportunity to streamline the user addition process with a Flow?  Company is going through massive growth and if I can build a Flow that will do the job and get it out to the business units, it would greatly alleviate the load on my Jr. Admin, make the business units thing they have &#039;absolute power!&#039; and would ensure that the right types of users get the right types of Profiles and Permission Sets.

The hitch is the sending of the password reset email.  Doable using a Flow?  Doable with a Trigger kicked by a Flow?  Doable, period, on an automated basis?

I can&#039;t be the first guy with this issue.  Your sticker is prominently displayed on my new laptop.  You&#039;ve become my spirit animal.]]></description>
