What is your goal? Share Groups allow you to share records owned by Community users with other users, both internal and external - on their account. To create a Sharing Group, you must first create a Sharing Set, then inside the Sharing Set you have the Sharing Group sub-tab. 
Scenario: you want to share cases  created and owned by Community users with internal users and other external users on the same account. In that scenario you&#039;d make a sharing set for your community, add cases to your sharing, then on the sub tab you can add any internal users then external users on that same account for members. In the group, ALL case records owned by community users are shared with those selected for members. 
Note, Share groups functionality isn’t available to users with Customer Community Plus and Partner Community licenses.

Based on your question, I&#039;d be happy to help with more info. Is it for all partners on all records? Is it for contacts on the same account? Are the partners the owners of the data? Do you have any lookup fields to account or contact or user? What license type? 

Sharing Sets and account relationship sharing are quite robust... ]]></description>

You can indeed, but not with the checkbox directly, I have steps on my Mass Import Community users post here: https://meighanrockssf.com/2021/03/08/mass-create-community-user/

Hope it helps!]]></description>

Just to validate, the users do have the Partner License correct?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Meighan,
after having added in LEAD object a custom field lookup to Channel Level Member, I am trying to use that field for setting a Lead Sharing rule. but, it seems that I cannot use channel fields in the  Lead sharing rules. 
Do you confirm that is it not possible to setup a sharing rule in a LEad based on an assigned CHannel Level Member ? Thanks in advance for a feedback]]></description>

Thanks Meighan,  my question is: if I prepare a .csv  with the list of Account IDs and IsPartner=TRUE , the update via data loader of the isPartner flag will enable the Partner features for those Accounts? 
Thanks

Absolutely it is! You want to create the accounts, then contacts on the account. It will create the first level role Partner User for example, if you leave role blank when creating the user. Here&#039;s a user import template: https://meighanrockssf.com/projects/mass-create-users/ let me know if you want more details. I&#039;ll add the additional Community user instructions tomorrow to the Mass Create Users page <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
