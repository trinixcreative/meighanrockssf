					<description><![CDATA[Thanks you so much.  I have everything (accounts,assets,cases,subscriptions) working with sharing sets and contact.relatedaccounts except service contracts.  In your description, you mention service contracts follow account sharing but is there some other setting I&#039;m missing?]]></description>

Do you have create? What about access to required fields set with automation? Does the owner update and if so does the new owner have access?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[great article... perhaps the best I&#039;ve seen yet on Sharing Sets.

I&#039;ve setup sharing sets and overall work as expected... though only with existing data.    Attempting to create a record for an object that the sharing set has been applied fails with &#039;insufficient access, etc, etc.&#039;

any thoughts on the matter would be much appreciated.  thx.]]></description>

They show the same data for the records a user could see. If. CC+ and the running user on a dashboard I can see all my data. If you want their accounts associated oops I&#039;d do a formula for my accounts if x field is true the show in report. Or do you mean related to their account? If so A sharing set works. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was great! Thank you. I&#039;m curious if anyone has any insight into the ways that dynamic dashboards and sharing sets interact in the context of Community digital experience. Do the dashboards based on running user follow the internal sharing rules or do they defer to the new sharing set criteria assigned to profile? Ultimately, I want to be able to feature a dashboard that ONLY reflects that related user&#039;s account and associated opportunities. 

Sharing set criteria for the profile is currently: User:Contact.RelatedAccount = Account:Id AND User:Contact.RelatedAccount = Opportunity:Account

Thanks in advance!]]></description>
